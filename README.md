**Visa Credit Card Transaction Analysis**
Unlocking Customer Insights to Maximize Transaction Value


**Project Overview**
This project analyzes over 1.29M Visa credit card transactions to uncover customer behavior patterns, detect fraud, and identify opportunities to maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
Using Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data wrangling & analysis and Tableau for dashboard creation, the study delivers actionable insights for marketing, risk, and engagement teams.

**Business Objectives**
Identify high-value customers and stable spenders

Detect fraud patterns and high-risk behaviors

Recognize customers at risk of churn or inactivity

Analyze time-based and category-based spending patterns

Build a CLV proxy for segmentation and targeted engagement

**Tools & Technologies**
**Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Jupyter Notebook:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, insights generation
**Tableau:** Interactive dashboards for storytelling and KPI tracking

**Key Insights**
Time-Based Behavior â€“ Night-time spending (12â€“6 AM) accounts for 8.2% of total spend; requires targeted offers & fraud monitoring.
Category Spend Patterns â€“ Grocery & Gas dominate transaction volume; Travel & Online Shopping have higher average spend.
Fraud Trends â€“ Online (NET) transactions show highest fraud rates, especially late-night; POS transactions are safer.
Customer Segmentation â€“ A small high-value segment drives majority of spend; low-frequency users show higher fraud risk.
Seasonality â€“ Significant dip in Jan 2020, sharp recovery in Feb; indicates event-driven or seasonal trends.

**Tableau Dashboard Features**
